# Routes & Navigation
 Lab activity: creating a multi-screen Flutter routes and navigating between them

# Project Description
 This Flutter project demonstrates navigation concepts through a multi-screen application featuring four screens (firstscreen, secondscreen, thirdscreen, and fourthscreen). The app integrates a bottom navigator options. Screen transitions are implemented using Navigator.push and Navigator.pop, enabling seamless navigation between pages. The application is styled with a custom color theme (pinkish white), ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design. The project structure is modular, with each screen defined in seperate files, and the main logic, such as drawer and bottom navigation bar are handled in main.dart. This app serves as a practical implementation of Flutter's routing and navigation capabilities, combined with a responsive and user-friendly UI.

# Challenges Faced During Project Making Process
 During the making process of this project, one of the key challenges were synchronizing the navigation state across multiple navigation tools, such as the bottom navigation bar and the navigation drawer. Another challenge was handling back navigation correctly, especially when implementing Navigator.push and Navigator.pop for making transitions between screens.

# Installation
 1. Flutter SDK: Ensure Flutter is installed and set up on your system. Follow the official Flutter installation guide (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
 2. IDE: use and IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/liwangivone/Routes---Navigation
    
    cd <project_directory>
    
    flutter pub get
    ```

# Usage
 1. Type flutter run on the terminal or use the run and debugging button.
 2. Choose the device which you prefer to launch the application, on the bottom right section.
 3. Click on the run and debug button and wait until the application launches.
 4. If you are using chrome or edge, don't forget to inspect and customize the size of the frame into a mobile one.
 5. The application now is ready to use.
 6. Specifically, you can use this app to move from one screen to another by pressing the button on the middle of the screen or using the bottom navigation bar and navigation drawer.
