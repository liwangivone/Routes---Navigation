# Routes & Navigation
 Lab activity: creating a multi-screen Flutter routes and navigating between them
 
 This Flutter project demonstrates navigation concepts through a mult-screen application featuring four screens (firstscreen, secondscreen, thirdscreen, and fourthscreen). The app integrates a bottom navigator options. Screen transitions are implemented using Navigator.push and Navigator.pop, enabling seamless navigation between pages. The application is styled with a custom color theme (pinkish white), ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design. The project structure is modular, with each screen defined in seperate files, and the main logic, such as drawer and bottom navigation bar are handled in main.dart. This app serves as a practical implementation of Flutter's routing and navigation capabilities, combined with a responsive and user-friendly UI.
 
 During the making process of this project, one of the key challenges were synchronizing the navigation state across multiple navigation tools, such as the bottom navigation bar and the navigation drawer. Another challenge was handling back navigation correctly, especially when implementing Navigator.push and Navigator.pop for making transitions between screens.
